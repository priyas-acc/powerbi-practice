# 🏥 Hospital Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project

An end-to-end Business Intelligence dashboard created using Power BI as part of my **Data Analytics Internship**. This project focuses on analyzing hospital operations, patient trends, departmental efficiency, and healthcare outcomes using real-world healthcare data.

---

## 💼 Internship Project Overview

As a Data Analytics Intern, I designed and developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to help **Healthy Life Hospitals** monitor performance across departments, understand patient demographics, and make data-driven operational decisions. The dashboard supports insights into patient satisfaction, treatment outcomes, staff allocation, and regional performance.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an interactive, user-friendly dashboard using Power BI
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and demographic trends
- Generate actionable insights for strategic healthcare management

## 🧹 Data Preparation Process

- Removed duplicate records and null values
- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., status, department)
- Converted data types for accurate aggregation and filtering
- Created calculated columns and measures using DAX

## 📝 Summary Report Overview

The final report includes insights and recommendations drawn from visual analytics. Key findings include:

- **Operational Efficiency:** High patient loads in specific departments suggest the need for resource balancing.
- **Age-Based Demand:** Services are most used by youth and middle-aged adults.
- **Readmissions & ICU:** Indicate areas for improved follow-up care.
- **Regional Dependence:** A large portion of patients comes from a few key states.
- **Gender Distribution:** Shows service preference and demographic behavior by department.

### 📌 Recommendations

- Reallocate staff to high-load weekdays (Thursdays & Fridays)
- Strengthen follow-up protocols to reduce readmissions
- Invest in high-volume departments and improve underperformers
- Explore regional outreach to balance patient distribution
- Promote gender-sensitive service offerings
